# Adding Product Guide

A product requires:

-   Name
-   Brand
-   Quantity
-   Price (in Php)

## First Step

-   Provide a unique product name.
-   Description is optional but only 256 characters are allowed.

## Second Step

-   A product brand is required.
-   At least one category for a product is required.

## Third Step

-   An initial price can be edited, so it's not required.
-   A minimum quantity can be edited, so it's not required.
-   Add initial stock quantities from various available storage locations.
    -   To add, click **"+ Location"**, and choose a location and the quantity.
    -   Press the **"x"** button to remove the row entry.

## Fourth Step

-   Choose an image that will be shown when showcasing the product.
-   Please choose a 1:1 aspect ratio image as this application only supports 1:1 images to for making it look good.
-   This image is preferred to have a white background as our application naively removes almost white colors in an image, resulting in broken images for grayish backgrounds. An example would be:
